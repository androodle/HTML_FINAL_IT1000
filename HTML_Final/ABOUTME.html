            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>I am currently a student at the <a href="https://missouri.edu/about">University of Missouri-Columbia</a>, where I pursue a degree in Information Technology.  I attended <a href="https://www.desmet.org/about">De Smet Jesuit High School</a> and <a href="https://stmonicastl.org/school/">Saint Monica Catholic School</a> for elementary and middle school.</p>
            <p>In school I have always gravitated more towards math and science, often times disregarding the other subjects.  I have always had an interest in computers and built my own system in 8th grade after saving up money for just over 18 months.  I have gone on to help build about 6-7 systems for friends and family.  Due to this interest, I always figured I would end up in a technology field.</p>
            <p>During my time in high school when quarantine hit, I picked up a new hobby.  This hobby just happened to be <strong>music composition</strong>.  I instantly fell in love with it and spent many hours learning the basics.  After wrapping my head around the fundamentals of <strong>music theory</strong> I began noticing some interesting patterns that I couldn&#39;t seem to find in any resources.  These patterns have lead me on what has felt like a <em>wild goose chase</em> for multiple years now.  <strong>My goal is to combine my passion for technology with my passion for music and see what I comes from it.</strong></p>

            <h2>Present Day</h2>
            <p>When not working on school related work, I spend most of my time hanging out with my <a href="./MYFRIENDS.html">friends</a>, working on my <a href="./THEORY.html">Theory of Systematic Relativity</a>, playing <a href="./VIDEOGAMES.html">my favorite video games</a>, and listening to <a href="./COMPOSERS.html">my favorite composers</a>.</p>

            <h2>Coding Projects</h2>
            <p>I am quite a novice and inexperienced programmer at the time of writing this.  For instance, it was only about two months ago when I first wrote the <em>Hello World</em> program.</h3>
    <pre>
        <code>
            <p></p>print('Hello World!')</p>
        </code>
    </pre>
